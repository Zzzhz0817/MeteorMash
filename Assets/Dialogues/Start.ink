// Start Dialogue: Waking Up Floating in Space

I snap awake to the vast emptiness of space. My suit hisses—a soft, steady leak. The HUD flashes: Oxygen: 18%. Suit breach detected. My head spins as I twist around.

“What… what happened?”

=== look_around ===
Looking around, behind me, an alien warship looms, with a gaping hole where the airlock used to be. Then it hits me — Grady was cutting through the hatch. He thought it was safe, an airlock we could use. But as soon as we breached it...

“BOOM. God, the explosion… I blacked out.”

The thought sends a chill down my spine. My crew—Grady, Singh, Juno—what happened to them? Are they alive? I fumble for the comms.

“Grady? Singh? Juno? Can anyone hear me?”  

Nothing but static. I curse under my breath, my eyes locking onto the salvage ship. It hangs far away, impossibly distant. The life trackers are on the ship. I need to get there to check on them, using the precious oxygen to boost.

My chest tightens as I look around. The salvage ship glints in the distance. My HUD calculates the trajectory. Boosting directly? It’ll take more oxygen than I have.

“No tether. Not enough air. Great. Alright… think.”

I spot a small asteroid floating between me and the ship. If I can land on it and push off, I might get enough momentum without burning too much oxygen.

“Okay. One step at a time. Get to that rock first.”

With a shaky hand, I activate the suit’s air thrusters.

A quick burst propels me forward. The hiss grows louder.

“Easy… conserve the oxygen. One burst at a time.”

// add Beginner's Tutorial for graping the asteroid here
With a thud, I land on its surface, gripping a jagged edge to steady myself. I catch my breath, the hissing of my suit relentless.

“Easy… just a little more.”

// add Beginner's Tutorial for crawling and aiming here
I angle my body, orienting toward the ship.

“Alright. Now for the hard part.”

// add Beginner's Tutorial for pushing off here
I crouch, coil my arms and legs, and push off with everything I’ve got. The asteroid recedes, the ship growing larger. Every second counts.
